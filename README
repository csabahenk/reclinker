reclinker
=========

reclinker is a recursive symlinking utility. It mirrors a hierarchy of files
by means of symlinks.

It's similar to http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/[GNU Stow], however:

- written in pure C (no dependencies, fast)
- free of forced, confusing package management terminology
  (like _stow dir_, _target dir_, _package_)
- supports both absolut and relative linking
- supports linking into existing hierarchies, handles
  properly already existing directory symlinks in the
  target hierarchy (like `/usr/man -> share/man`)
- supports access control (set ownership/mode of created
  links/directories, filter processed files based on
  ownership/mode requirements)
- license is LGPL, not GPL (some may think it's a feature)

It also has a feature which makes it similar to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cpio[cpio]
passthrough mode: reclinker can take a list of files on stdin, and link only those
files which occur in the list.

reclinker was written to be the part of a more comprehensive symlinky package management
scheme, http://creo.hu/~csaba/projects/ifs[IFS]. IFS is not ready but you can just start
using reclinker immediately.

Current version is 0.4.
